# Advent of Code 2023

I'm using Haskell again for this year's challenge! I've also decided to comment my solutions so that I can still
understand my code ten minutes after writing it, but I'm also trying to add things that might be useful for learners
(like me!). As the days go on, I'll probably end up commenting only on more advanced concepts, so there'll be a kind of
progression. I'm no expert myself though, so I can't promise that everything will be optimal and clean...

## Running the code

I'm not sure how any of this works on Windows, but there's a simple Bash script in this directory that uses
[Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/) to run a single solution. Run `DayNN.hs` with `./run NN` (e.g.
`./run 08` will run `Day08.hs`).
